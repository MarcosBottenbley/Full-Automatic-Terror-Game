600.255: Intro to Video Game Design
Assignment 12: Any way you like it!

Problem 1: Progress

We added a bunch of new features for this assignment. First of all, we added 
another level to the game to follow the scrapyard. This level is called "siege", 
and it involves defeating enemies that spawn in waves. The level has 6 waves, 
and inside these waves are a new enemy type: the Scaredborg. Scaredborgs run 
away from you and leave behind a trail of "space goo" that slows down your ship 
on contact. 

Another feature is our tutorial level. We removed the "How to Play" menu in favor 
of instructions written on our first level. This tutorial level is the first level 
upon starting a new game and is accessible through the level select as well. 

We also made some adjustments to the Moon and Sun Bosses. The Moon Boss now moves 
in a smooth pattern rather than jumping around spasmodically. Also, both bosses 
bounce the player off on contact so that the player no longer gets stuck inside 
of them. 

The parallax overlay was fixed to make the backgrounds less distracting.

The Circleborg enemies were changed to be colored red instead of blue. That way, 
they contrast better with the darker backgrounds on each level.

Finally, we adjusted the weapon cooldown times so that the weapons would be more 
balanced and players would be less inclined to only use one for the entire game.

#Gameplay

If there any problems with the high score screen, please delete 
local data in your Love save directory:

Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\LOVE\ or %appdata%\LOVE\
Windows Vista and 7: C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LOVE or %appdata%\LOVE\
Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/love/ or ~/.local/share/love/
Mac: /Users/user/Library/Application Support/LOVE/

Move the ship with the arrow keys or WASD and press Z to shoot
(this locks the player's angle).
Press 1 to switch between the laser and missile weapons, 
C to use a bomb, and space to use a hyperjump.
Holding X will stop the angle from locking while firing.

Enter the yellow portal to win the level (unless otherwise specified).
Destroying an enemy is +200 points and clearing the game yields a
+3000 point bonus.
We decided to go with a simple approach for scoring points since
a main focus of our game is ship-to-ship combat.
