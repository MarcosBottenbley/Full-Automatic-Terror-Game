600.255: Intro to Video Game Design
Assignment 4: Win, Lose, Scores
#Gameplay

Move the ship with the arrow keys or WASD and press Z to shoot.
Destroy all the enemies to win the game, but be careful, since
touching once of them means game over.
Destroying an enemy is +200 points and clearing the game yields a
+3000 point bonus.
We decided to go with a simple approach for scoring points since
a main focus of our game is ship-to-ship combat.
