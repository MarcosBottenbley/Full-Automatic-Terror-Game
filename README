600.255: Intro to Video Game Design
Assignment 6: Stepping up to Level One

Problem 1: Level One

This first complete level has been completed. Our game also has an opening 
story that can be skipped by pressing the spacebar or any other key. 
It flashes through the text upon starting the game. The player wins by 
destroying the boss on the level. The player loses by running out of health. 
The invincibility feature is also implemented by pressing the "i" key. 
More destroyed enemies means higher scores. We decided not to screen wrap yet
because this would become confusing to the player without a mini-map.

Problem 2: Technical, Artistic, and Game Play Progress

Upon laughing the game and selecting the play option, the player sees the 
story unfold over some text. This is skip-able, in case they have already 
seen it. We have an invincibility feature that is activated by pressing "i" 
and deactivated by pressing it again. The boss has been added, with sound and 
visual effects when it is hit and a firing sequence in a circle around itself. 
This is useful for destroying enemies for you. We updated our game over and win 
screens to look more professional as well. The player has health now, as shown 
in the top left corner of the screen. The player also has a sound effect when 
they are hit. The enemies also do not deal damage once they are destroyed. 
Spatial hashing was also implemented.



#Gameplay

Please delete local data in your AppData folder (may be hidden)
because the hi-score screen now accepts 6 hi-scores instead of 5.

Move the ship with the arrow keys or WASD and press Z to shoot.
Destroy all the enemies to win the game, but be careful, since
touching once of them means game over.
Destroying an enemy is +200 points and clearing the game yields a
+3000 point bonus.
We decided to go with a simple approach for scoring points since
a main focus of our game is ship-to-ship combat.
