600.255: Intro to Video Game Design
Assignment 5: Scrolling Level Zero!

Problem 1: Level Zero

In our game, "four screen-fulls of stuff" consists of a 2000x2000 arena
with an 800x600 camera. The player is tasked with destroying all the
enemies in the area, which would be similar to the gameplay of our final
concept (complete a certain objective while exploring a large area)

Problem 2: Camera and Scrolling

Our game has the screen center on the player's ship as it moves around 
the game world. Once the player reaches one of the predetermined boundaries
for the arena (these are invisible right now, later they will be visible or
we'll implement Asteroids-esque screen wrapping) the camera stops moving in
that direction. Currently, we don't have a camera class (the movement is 
handled by a couple lines in the Game class) but we'll add one later to
implement "juicy" effects.

#Gameplay

Move the ship with the arrow keys or WASD and press Z to shoot.
Destroy all the enemies to win the game, but be careful, since
touching once of them means game over.
Destroying an enemy is +200 points and clearing the game yields a
+3000 point bonus.
We decided to go with a simple approach for scoring points since
a main focus of our game is ship-to-ship combat.
