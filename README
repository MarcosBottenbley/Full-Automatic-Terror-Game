600.255: Intro to Video Game Design
Assignment 11: Have It Your Way!

Problem 1: Progress

For this assignment, we decided to add a new level as well as a handful of new 
features. First, we added a new type of enemy to levels 3A and 4 (which is actually 
our new level and is accessed after beating either 3A or 3B, our fourth level). This 
type of enemy is a stationary turret that fires double shots and rotates between two 
specified angles. Hitting a turret with one of your shots stuns the turret for a short
duration, darkening its color, rendering it unable to shoot or rotate, and making an 
"electrifying" particle effect. 

The player also now has bars instead of numbers to represent health and weapon cooldown
times. In addition, to allow more screen space for the player to see, the "BOMBS:" and 
"HYPERJUMPS:" texts were replaced with symbols. 

In cooperation with the weapon cooldown bar is a new weapon for the player to use. It is 
equipped with the '3' key and can charge up while the player holds down the fire button. 
When at full power (flashing light-blue bar), the player can release the fire button to 
unleash a larger, more damaging, penetrating shot. 

We also added a fifth level to identify as our level 4. The goal of this level is to 
deal with any enemies while collecting four mysterious gadget parts. These parts will 
be combined to create something that will aid the player in future levels. We have a couple 
of ideas as to what these will become: either a mine-dropper weapon or a split-shot weapon.

Finally, we made some changes to the Moon Boss on level 3B. It now moves and summons other 
enemies. 


#Gameplay

If there any problems with the high score screen, please delete 
local data in your Love save directory:

Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\LOVE\ or %appdata%\LOVE\
Windows Vista and 7: C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LOVE or %appdata%\LOVE\
Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/love/ or ~/.local/share/love/
Mac: /Users/user/Library/Application Support/LOVE/

Move the ship with the arrow keys or WASD and press Z to shoot
(this locks the player's angle).
Press 1 to switch between the laser and missile weapons, 
C to use a bomb, and space to use a hyperjump.
Holding X will stop the angle from locking while firing.

Enter the yellow portal to win the level (unless otherwise specified).
Destroying an enemy is +200 points and clearing the game yields a
+3000 point bonus.
We decided to go with a simple approach for scoring points since
a main focus of our game is ship-to-ship combat.
