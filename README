600.255: Intro to Video Game Design
Assignment 13

For this assignment we made graphics changes to our game to make
it more visually appealing. We are making progress on new controls
that will be completed for the Gold presentation.

#Gameplay

If there any problems with the high score screen, please delete 
local data in your Love save directory:

Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\LOVE\ or %appdata%\LOVE\
Windows Vista and 7: C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LOVE or %appdata%\LOVE\
Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/love/ or ~/.local/share/love/
Mac: /Users/user/Library/Application Support/LOVE/

Move the ship with the arrow keys or WASD and press Z to shoot
(this locks the player's angle).
Press 1 to switch between the laser and missile weapons, 
C to use a bomb, and space to use a hyperjump.
Holding X will stop the angle from locking while firing.

Enter the yellow portal to win the level (unless otherwise specified).
Destroying an enemy is +200 points and clearing the game yields a
+3000 point bonus.
We decided to go with a simple approach for scoring points since
a main focus of our game is ship-to-ship combat.
