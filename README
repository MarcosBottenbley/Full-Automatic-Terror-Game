600.255: Intro to Video Game Design
Assignment 8: Level Three Is The Place To Be!

Problem 1: Level Three

(see game)

Problem 2: Technical, Artistic, and Game Play Progress

For this assignment, we made a bunch of improvements to the other 
two levels and added the third level. First of all, the player 
now has another special ability: the HyperJump. This power grants 
the player a massive speed boost directly in front of them for 1 
second. While advancing at this rapid speed, the player also does 
not take any damage and destroys all non-boss enemies in its path. 

This next addition is what essentially makes the third level 
possible: Walls. The third level is a wormhole-based teleportation 
puzzle. The walls divide the level into smaller sectors and the 
player must use the wormholes to navigate through them to find the 
end. The end of this level is marked by another new feature: the 
Golden Portal. This distinct wormhole will be used in all of our 
levels as a simpler way to transition between levels. However, for 
levels one and two, the conditions must be met in order for the 
Golden Portal to appear. Because level three has no enemies, 
it currently has no loss condition unless the player gets 
frustrated and quits.

Level one now has a new enemy flying around: the CircleBorg. It 
does not aim to hit the player immediately. Rather, when it comes 
within a certain distance of the player, it starts to move in 
circles around them. While circling, it slowly closes its distance 
in a spiral motion until it is destroyed or it reaches you. 

Some of the key bindings have been revised to make it easier for 
the player to reach them all quickly. HyperJump is activated with 
the spacebar and bomb is activated with the 'c' key. Firing 
bullets and invincibility are still the same, with the 'z' key and 
the 'i' key, respectively.

Finally, we made it so that the Phantom Ships and Dual Masters do 
not shoot bullets. Our level two was too overwhelming with all of 
the flying bullets and we do not want our game to be a bullet hell. 
An enemy hell is much more fitting and it is still challenging even 
without the bullets.



#Gameplay

Please delete local data in your AppData folder (may be hidden)
because the hi-score screen now accepts 6 hi-scores instead of 5.

Move the ship with the arrow keys or WASD and press Z to shoot.
Destroy all the enemies to win the game, but be careful, since
touching once of them means game over.
Destroying an enemy is +200 points and clearing a level yields a
+3000 point bonus.
We decided to go with a simple approach for scoring points since
a main focus of our game is ship-to-ship combat.
