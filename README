600.255: Intro to Video Game Design
Assignment 7: Level Two Where are You?

Problem 1: Level Two

(see game)

Problem 2: Technical, Artistic, and Game Play Progress

First, the main menu has changed. Instead of brightness and volume 
controls, they have been combined into a settings menu. Here, 
audio, video, and control settings are changed from a single source.

After choosing play and going through the opening story, the game 
starts out with the camera panned out and then quickly zooms in to 
the center of the map where the player is located. The player has 
two new weapons to use to deal with the surrounding enemies. By 
pressing 'b', the player can flash a devastating bomb that destroys 
all non-boss enemies on the screen. However, the player starts out 
with only three. The number remaining is reflected at the top of the 
screen (the HUD, so to speak). By pressing '1', the player can switch 
weapons, either to the laser blaster that fires in a straight line or 
to the seeker charge that zeroes in on enemy units. Upon being hit by 
an enemy, there is a screen shaking animation. The player can also 
strafe by holding 'x' and moving to the side.

In terms of gameplay, some new mechanics have been implemented. 
Spatial hashing and buckets are used to make collision code simpler. 
There are also new Power Ups located throughout the levels. The blue 
orb is the old double shot, the lightning bolt is a speed increase, 
and the wrench sign is a health increase. A gimmick of level two is 
the wormhole, which the player can enter to be teleported to another 
wormhole. However, there is a cool down time before another teleport 
can be used. Also unique to level two is a new enemy: the DualMaster. 
With double the firepower, it poses a new threat to the player. The 
Sun Boss also has a fast spinning animation and then an explosion 
animation upon being destroyed, making the transition between levels 
more fluid. Once the boss is beaten, there is a new text animation 
that introduces the level.

Level two has no boss, but instead introduces a horde-mode style of 
play. There is a timer of two minutes in the player’s HUD. By 
surviving until the time is up, the player wins the level.



#Gameplay

Please delete local data in your AppData folder (may be hidden)
because the hi-score screen now accepts 6 hi-scores instead of 5.

Move the ship with the arrow keys or WASD and press Z to shoot.
Destroy all the enemies to win the game, but be careful, since
touching once of them means game over.
Destroying an enemy is +200 points and clearing the game yields a
+3000 point bonus.
We decided to go with a simple approach for scoring points since
a main focus of our game is ship-to-ship combat.
