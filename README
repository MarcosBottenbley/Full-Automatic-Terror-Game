600.255: Intro to Video Game Design
Assignment 10: The Door to Level Four

Problem 1: Level Four

Our new level lets us implement a part of our game that we've been meaning to
add for a while: branching levels. With this update, if you're overwhelmed
by the swarms of enemies in sector 2, then you are taken to level 3A (our previous
level 3). If you win, then you jump to the new level 3B, a gauntlet of bouncing 
asteroids with a new boss enemy at the end.

Problem 2: Technical, Artistic, and Game Play Progress

For Level 3B, we added an asteroid object that drifts with constant speed and
bounces off the laser walls and screen edges. This plays a big role in the new level, and we 
ended up breaking years of space shooter tradition by making them immune
to bullets. (Sorry, Atari.) After testing, we all thought level 3B was a 
little too easy if you could just shoot your way through.
The new level also features a new boss, a moon robot that's the counterpart
to level 1's sun boss.

In addition to the things we added for the new level, this update includes 
a few changes to the general flow of the game. In our last build,
winning a level or dying would immediately throw to a cutscene or game over 
screen, which was a little jarring. We've added the "Sector Clear" screen 
back into the game once a level is clear so the player is more aware of what's
going on. Additionally, we fixed a bug that was skipping the player's explode
animation and added an intro screen for each level.

Rounding out the update is a couple of small bug fixes and features. The locked-
angle "strafe" movement is working again after behaving oddly in the alpha build.
Wormholes now are able to warp the player to an arbitrary point instead of 
automatically being set to the closest wormhole in the objects table. (This has
the added effect of not crashing the game whenever there are an odd number of
wormholes in a level.) Finally, we added a pause screen with options to quit or 
restart which can be accessed by pressing the Escape key during normal gameplay.

#Gameplay

If there any problems with the high score screen, please delete 
local data in your Love save directory:

Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\LOVE\ or %appdata%\LOVE\
Windows Vista and 7: C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LOVE or %appdata%\LOVE\
Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/love/ or ~/.local/share/love/
Mac: /Users/user/Library/Application Support/LOVE/

Move the ship with the arrow keys or WASD and press Z to shoot
(this locks the player's angle).
Press 1 to switch between the laser and missile weapons, 
C to use a bomb, and space to use a hyperjump.
Holding X will stop the angle from locking while firing.

Enter the yellow portal to win the level (unless otherwise specified).
Destroying an enemy is +200 points and clearing the game yields a
+3000 point bonus.
We decided to go with a simple approach for scoring points since
a main focus of our game is ship-to-ship combat.
