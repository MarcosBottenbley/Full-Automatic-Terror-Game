Animation Intro Text:



Your ship has been captured by a formidable 
galactic empire.

You must escape from behind enemy lines 
and return home.

However, these foreign sectors of space are 
riddled with hostile forces and natural dangers.

All that stands between you and death is your 
ship, its shields, and its weapons.

Will you survive and reach your home planet?



Potential Puzzle Concepts:
- Laser reflection to open gate (like from Marcos’s game)
- Bait an enemy weapon shot to open gate (maybe you need 
to hit one target and the enemy has to hit another one 
at the same time, or maybe the enemy’s missile will follow 
you and you have to bait it through a maze by moving around 
it)
- Shoot buttons in a certain order shown somewhere else
in the level (like lightning staff upgrade from Origins)
- Kill enemies in a certain order specified earlier 
(they respawn if they are out of order or after a set 
amount of time)
