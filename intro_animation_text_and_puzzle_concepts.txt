Animation Intro Text:



Your home planet, Trora, is located in the Meyliv Galaxy.

The nearby Zenith Nebula had drawn scientific minds from 
around the universe to study its strange energy.

Trora's officials did not want this to escalate into an 
energy race, for that would lead to war.

However, they did not have the knowledge to harness the 
energy alone. 

They made a deal that would satisfy everyone, but would 
also leave Trora with an advantage.

Everyone shared their knowledge and, as a result, they 
were able to harness and contain the energy.

As payment for their contributions, each participant was 
given a share of the resource.

However, Trora kept the most because they were closest to 
the nebula.

They used the Zenith Energy to create a line of 
powerful spacecraft for their leader’s escort.

You are the pilot of one of these ships.

The residents of a another planet, Snides, sought these 
ships in order to reverse engineer them.

While they are masters of teleportation technology, they 
could not match Trora’s speed and firepower.

They ambushed you on your way back to Trora and captured 
you.

Several months have passed, and the enemy has created an 
enhanced army of ships with the energy.

As they were about to eliminate you, you somehow managed 
to escape.

You must survive and reach home in order to warn your 
planet of the imminent threat.



Potential Puzzle Concepts:
- Laser reflection to open gate (like from Marcos’s game)
- Bait an enemy weapon shot to open gate (maybe you need 
to hit one target and the enemy has to hit another one 
at the same time, or maybe the enemy’s missile will follow 
you and you have to bait it through a maze by moving around 
it)
- Shoot buttons in a certain order shown somewhere else
in the level (like lightning staff upgrade from Origins)
- Kill enemies in a certain order specified earlier 
(they respawn if they are out of order or after a set 
amount of time)
