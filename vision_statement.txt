Revised Vision
------------------------
Background Story:
Your ship has been captured by enemy fighters and taken to another 
sector of space. The overall goal in this game is to escape from 
behind enemy lines and return home. This game does not involve any
ally characters that will aid you; it places the emphasis on 
being in space all alone. Your motivation is a combination of 
survival and escape. You will explore individuals worlds trying 
to escape the sector, encountering heavy resistance along the way.
By completing objectives, you will travel to new areas. The 
choices of objectives you complete will affect the course of 
your game.


Game Setting:
This game takes place in several foreign sectors of space. Each 
sector has its own unique effect that it has, creating new 
obstacles for the player. It is difficult to say when this game 
takes place because time dilation in space is very complex. 
However, the technologies presented in both the enemy\'92s units 
and in the upgrades that you find indicate that the game may take 
place in the distant future. Each level is a wide area with a 
handful of objectives (choices); therefore, exploration is key to 
complete each level and advance in the game. In space, we will use 
several obstacles that take advantage of the environment, 
including asteroids, gravity fields, wormholes, and a few other 
surprises. This game uses 8-directional movement.

Level Design:
So far, we have 3 levels planned out, each with its own signature 
effect.

Level 1: Asteroid Field: Hence its name, this level's gimmick is 
asteroids floating around. This level by far contains the most 
asteroids. This helps the player learn to control their ship 
quickly and accurately in order to avoid or destroy the various 
moving rocks. There are also a few enemies in this level so that 
the player can learn to avoid or destroy their projectiles. This 
level will either end with a warp gate or, depending on how much 
time we have, a level boss that combines standard projectiles with 
two tractor beam attacks: one grabs nearby asteroids and throws 
them at you, and the other is a wide attack that pulls your ship 
in and deals damage. This level is fairly linear and only has this 
one objective.

Level 2: Gravity Field: This level has a new gimmick: gravity 
fields. Gravity fields looks like orange circles. However, they 
pull your ship towards them. The force in which they pull varies 
depending on how close you are to it. If your ship touches its 
core, you take damage and are then freed from the pull for a few 
seconds. There is also a mechanic where asteroids will orbit 
around the core, increasing in speed and moving closer to the core 
until they crumble when they reach it. This level will have 
multiple objectives which will lead to one level or another. One 
objective will be an offense mission to destroy an enemy power 
source while the other will be to defend a crashed satellite from 
enemy attackers. If the defense mission is chosen, you are 
rewarded with a cloaking field. If the offense mission is chosen, 
you gain some energy from the source and gain lightning blasts as 
a result.


Level 3: Wormhole Zone: The gimmick of this level is using 
wormholes to warp from place to place. Wormholes appear in places 
around the level and they take you to specific other places in the 
level. These are necessary to guide your ship around impassable 
objects. They can also be used defensively to escape an enemy 
swarm or be used offensively to trick enemy ships into them. In 
this level, enemy ships have the power to warp. Therefore, the 
player will have to react quickly to surprise warped ambushes. 
Asteroids also travel through wormholes upon contact. This level 
will also likely have two objectives: one of which will give your 
ship a drill to bore through asteroids while the other will grant 
you area of effect shots in a cone in front of your ship.


Game Mechanics:
While there is no specific score in the game and the overall goal 
is to reach the end of the game, the statistics of the number of 
deaths, enemies of each type killed, etc. are kept. The basic 
controls are 8-directional and, although a motion control system 
similar to asteroids would be nostalgic, it seems like an overly 
complicated motion scheme for what we are aiming for. There are 
several types of power upgrades, some of which are permanent while 
others are only temporary. In general, permanent upgrades are 
smaller than the temporary ones. Upgrades can be characterized by 
offense, defense, speed, along with some rarer upgrades such as 
lightning blasts, sonic waves, or cloaking fields. The key to this 
game is firepower; however, sometimes dexterity to avoid larger 
obstacles is also necessary. This game does have distinct levels, 
some of which will not even be visited during the first play 
through because this game appears linear, but actually has several 
paths to the goal. There are bosses, which will be largely figured 
out later. While all of the levels are based on the themes of 
exploration and achieving objectives, each level will have a new 
special gimmick, some of which are described in the level design 
section. The player will have both shield power and lives. There 
are shield rechargers and upgrades. However, there are no bonus 
lives. Because each level is exploring the environment, it is 
possible to navigate forwards and backwards through the level. 
Once the game is beaten, we plan on adding some extra features. 
For example, only then can you revisit previous levels in the game. 
There are also going to be a boss rush game mode and/or a sandbox 
mode if we have time at the end.


-----------------------
Development Plan
-----------------------
Alpha Release: We expect that this version of the game will have a 
single working level. Therefore, they are no warp gates between 
levels. At this point, we should have our ship designed and 
implemented. The ship should operate properly with 8-directional 
motion and shooting mechanics. There will be a few enemies and a few 
upgrades in consistent spots around the map. This level will also a 
relatively simple boss and, when it is defeated, the player is 
victorious. This will establish that death screens, victory screens, 
statistics, and the majority of general mechanics are functional 
before advancing to multiple different levels and enemy types.

Beta Release: This should have everything from the alpha release, 
with an added introduction screen and story. The number of levels 
will also be increased to 3 with added between-level transition 
mechanics. This will implement more enemy and power-up types and 
abilities as well. Also, we should have a basic sound effects 
template and musical score by this point.

Gold Release: This game should be the game that was described in our 
vision statement. It will have even more levels (most likely up to 5)
along with several boss battles. If we have time, it will also 
include arcade-style challenge modes such as sandbox and boss 
battles.

Section 2: Group Roles:

To summarize, here are the responsibilities of all of us:

Rebecca: Graphics, Programming
Marcos: Programming
Adam: Storyboard and Design, Programming
David: Sound and Music, Programming

All four members of our group will be doing some programming over 
the course of the project. Marcos will be the lead programmer, as 
this is his focus. In addition, Rebecca will be doing the graphics 
and sprites, Adam will be doing the storyboard and design, and David 
will be doing the sound effects and the music. It all fits together 
like a puzzle. The story creates a general template for which the 
game's details fit in and the design creates the ideas for what 
the power-ups, enemies, and gimmicks do in order to give the game 
proper difficulty. Graphics takes power-ups, enemies, and your ship 
and brings them to life so that they can be later implemented. Sound 
effects will play whenever certain events happen and music will 
generally play over the course of the game (or level if the music is 
different between each one). Finally, the programming brings all of 
these aspects together and makes sure that everything works as 
expected.

Section 3: Major Risks:

The first risk is that the idea becomes bloated from too many new 
things being added, changing the idea of the game all the time. The 
way that we plan to mitigate this is by voting on new ideas as a 
team and making sure that everyone agrees on every idea. Also, we 
will make a precise schedule so that we know what we can and cannot 
fit into the game within our time limit.

The second risk is that we fall behind by not following our precise 
schedule. The way that we plan to mitigate this is by setting up 
several weekly meetings to make sure that everyone is on track and, 
if anyone is falling behind, to work together and make sure that we 
can catch up in a timely manner.

The third risk is computer death. This could result in losing key 
files. The way that we plan to mitigate this is by regularly backing 
up any project-related materials to our BitBucket repository (and 
also DropBox if we feel that multiple backups are necessary).
